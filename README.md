## How to Use This Package

This folder contains everything the team needs to build a presentation.

**Start here:**
1. Read `FINAL_REPORT.md` in this folder — it is the complete written report covering all phases with results, numbers, and analysis
2. Open each phase folder — each one has a `NOTES.md` with talking points and a description of every file inside it
3. Use the images and charts from each folder as slides

**Each phase folder is self-contained.** You do not need to open any notebooks or run any code. All outputs (charts, images, data) are already pre-generated and copied in.

## What Was Built

A complete deep learning pipeline for robotic strawberry harvesting:

```
Field photo → YOLOv11 detects strawberries → Crop around target fruit
           → U-Net segments the stem → PCA extracts stem angle
           → Gripper alignment angle for robot arm
```

## Folder Guide

### `FINAL_REPORT.md`
The full written project report. Covers all four modules, all results with numbers, honest analysis of limitations, and a rubric self-assessment. **Read this first.**

---

### `Phase1_Environment/`
**What:** Verified the Python/CUDA environment and installed all required packages.
**Key result:** NVIDIA RTX 5070 GPU confirmed, PyTorch + CUDA working, all packages installed.
| File | Use for |
|---|---|
| `NOTES.md` | Summary of environment setup, package versions, why `aida_stable` was chosen |

---

### `Phase2_YOLOv11_Training/`
**What:** Trained YOLOv11 segmentation model on 2,800 strawberry images.
**Key result:** mAP50 = 0.927 (detection), 0.918 (segmentation masks) — excellent accuracy.

---

### `Phase3_ROI_Crops/`
**What:** Used the trained YOLOv11 model to automatically crop a tight region around the largest strawberry in every image.
**Key result:** 3,100 / 3,100 images successfully cropped.

| File | Use for |
|---|---|
| `NOTES.md` | Talking points, method, confidence threshold decision explained |
| `roi_crops_sample.png` | **Slide: show this** — grid of sample crops |
| `module1_yolov11_training.ipynb` | Full code notebook (same as Phase 2 — ROI code is Cell 9) |

---

### `Phase4_Peduncle_Annotation/`
**What:** All four team members manually annotated the crown–stem–peduncle region using Roboflow + SAM. 357 annotated image/mask pairs produced.
**Key result:** 357 pairs total — 3.5× the 100-image minimum required by the spec.

| File | Use for |

---

### `Phase5_UNet_Training/`
**What:** Trained a U-Net neural network to automatically segment the crown–stem–peduncle region.
**Key result:** Best val IoU = 0.2291 at epoch 10. Overfitting observed after epoch 10 — documented and explained.

| File | Use for |
|---|---|
| `NOTES.md` | Talking points, architecture, hyperparameters, honest assessment of results |
| `unet_training_curves.png` | **Slide: show this** — point out peak at epoch 10, then overfitting |

---

### `Phase6_Stem_Angle/`
**What:** Applied PCA to U-Net predicted masks to extract the stem orientation angle — the robotic gripper alignment direction.
**Key result:** Mean stem angle 59.2° from horizontal across 50 val images. Before/after post-processing comparison included.

| File | Use for |
